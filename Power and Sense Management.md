# Power and Sense Management:
  In a self-driving car equipped with a DC motor and powered by a 12V battery, the power and sense management system play
  critical roles in ensuring safe and efficient operation. The DC motor acts as the primary propulsion source, converting electrical
  energy from the 12V battery into mechanical power to drive the vehicle's wheels. The power management aspect is responsible
  for intelligently distributing the battery's energy to different vehicle systems, optimizing energy usage to maximize the car's range and performance.

The power management system monitors the battery's voltage and current levels, regulating the motor's power output to
prevent overloading and potential damage. It also employs advanced algorithms to adjust power distribution based on driving
conditions, such as acceleration, braking, and navigating different terrains. By efficiently managing power usage, the self-driving
carcan extend its driving range and reduce the need for frequent recharging.

Moreover, the sense management aspect is equally crucial for the car's autonomous capabilities. It involves a combination of
sophisticated sensors like cameras, tcs 43725 color sensor, and ultrasonic sensors, which continuously gather real-time data about the car's
surroundings. The sense management system processes this wealth of information to make informed decisions regarding
navigation, obstacle avoidance, and response to dynamic road conditions.

The integration of power and sense management systems allows the self-driving car to achieve a harmonious synergy between
power efficiency and safety. By intelligently controlling the DC motor's power output and utilizing advanced sensor data, the
vehicle can autonomously navigate through traffic, adhere to traffic rules, and adapt to unexpected situations while efficiently
utilizing the energy provided by the 12V battery, ultimately offering a reliable and eco-friendly transportation solution for the future.
