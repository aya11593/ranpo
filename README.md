# Project Overview
We're the Ranpo, a passionate team from Palestine on a mission to conquer the WRO Future Engineers 2024 challenge by building a fully autonomous self-driving car! , our car is designed to navigate a designated track and complete three laps without human intervention. This project embodies our commitment to robotics, innovation, and the future of intelligent transportation.

### The WRO Challenge and Our Focus
The WRO Future Engineers category emphasizes the entire engineering process. Teams earn points for their final product and for documenting their journey within a public GitHub repository. This year's exciting challenge features a randomly changing track, testing our car's adaptability!

We're focusing on these key areas to build our autonomous car:

- **Sensor Fusion and Computer Vision:** We'll use  ultrasonic , color sensor , cameras , and computer vision to give our car a real-time understanding of its surroundings.
- **Open-Source Hardware:** We're building with readily available components like a RaSspberry Pi.
- **Optimization for Stability:** Our goal is to create a consistently reliable car capable of navigating the various track layouts.
- **Teamwork and Documentation:** Strong collaboration, communication, and a detailed engineering journal will be critical to our success.
